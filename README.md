# Micronaire

RAG pipelines enable developers to augment their chat experiences with informational
documents that their agents can leverage to provide better answers. Evaluating these
pipelines is a new area of study, with solutions like
[RAGChecker](https://github.com/amazon-science/RAGChecker) and
[RAGAS](https://github.com/explodinggradients/ragas) being state of the art
frameworks that are implemented in Python. This project aims to take these ideas and
bring them to DotNet through Semantic Kernel.

Micronaire brings actionable metrics to RAG pipeline evaluation by taking a set of
ground truth questions and answers as well as a RAG pipeline, evaluating the
pipeline against the ground truth using our metrics (see below), and then producing
an evaluation report.
